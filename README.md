Portal is an data browser that allows you to explore your personal data in SoLiD Pod.

## What is SoLiD

SoLiD(Social Linked Data) is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy.

SoLiD empowers users and organizations to separate their data from the applications that use it. It allows people to look at the same data with different apps at the same time. It opens brand new avenues for creativity, problem-solving, and commerce.

## What is Pod

Pods are where you store your data. Your WebID lets you login to SoLiD apps and Pods as well as letting you connect to other people using SoLiD.

## What is Portal

Portal is an data browser that allows you to explore your personal data in SoLiD Pod.

All interfaces of the Portal are customizable and consist of documents. We make documents into applications.

No more ping-ponging between documents, spreadsheets, and niche workflow apps to get things done. Portal brings all of your data into one flexible surface.
